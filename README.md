# Python Guided Project

Note:

* You are not allowed to use any internal `complex number` library or a python package that handle complex numbers.
* You can use other internal libraries if you like.

Define a class called `complex_number` which accepts 2 parameters:

* x: int64, float64, represents real component of the complex number
* y: int64, float64, represents imaginary component of the complex number

Example, `complex_number(3, 5)` means 3 is the real part of the complex number and 5 is the imaginary part of the complex number. Such a number is represented as 3 + 5i.

Here is [a resource](http://www.careerbless.com/aptitude/qa/complex_numbers_imp.php) to help you with the required information to solve this assignment. You can take help from other online resources as well.

### Questions:

Define the following operations for the class: 

* representation in the form of x + yi when used with `print` command
* '+'
* '-'
* '*'
* '/'
* abs()

* Note that these operations should be compatible with `int` and `float` datatypes as well

Also, define following methods.


* real() [Returns real component of the complex number]
* imag() [Returns complex component of the complex number]
* argument() [Returns argument of the complex number]
* conjugate() [Returns conjugate of the complex number]
